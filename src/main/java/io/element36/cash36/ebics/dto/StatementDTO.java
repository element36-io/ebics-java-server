/**
 * camt.053: end-of-day statement; Bank to Customer Statement (Bank > Customer); Same as : MT940
 * (Kontoauszug); Check:
 * https://www.sepaforcorporates.com/swift-for-corporates/a-practical-guide-to-the-bank-statement-camt-053-format/
 *
 * Retrieves bank statement and converts Camt.053 format to a simpler JSON-format.
 *  CAMT is an ISO 20022 Payment Message definition that stands for Cash Management 
 * and specifically covers Bank to Customer Cash Management reporting. In prod-mode 
 * with a real bank account you will get any statement ONLY ONCE: A bank statement is
 *  a legal document, not a query result. With this call you retrieve all Camt.053 
 * documents which have not been retrieved yet.This also means, that if you already
 *  have received (downloaded) all statements, then you will get an error, similar 
 * to: 'can not download request file'. E.g. if you issue the command without new 
 * transactions inbetween then you will see the error as well. Anyway you see all 
 * Camt.053 files in the configured out folder (ebics.outputDir). In dev mode you 
 * see the command which is issued to query the daily statement.
